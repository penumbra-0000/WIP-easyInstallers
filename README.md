Ninite is a Windows application used to easily install various programs to a Windows PC automagically.

This aims to replicate that experience but using various Python scripts for various Linux distributions.

This project is currently WIP as hell. There's only a Debian/Ubuntu version, and even that doesn't work yet. This repo exists purely for backup and as a launchpad for further development. Feel free to fork it if you have better ideas for this concept.
